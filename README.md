This is the script for SCP-914 from the gmod map "SCP Site 09" made by Kiwonta.



Why aren't spawned weapons working?

Only Entitys are working, that means only weapons are working, that were dropped via "/drop" command from darkRP.


Why isn't anything happening?
currently it is just working for the guth scp keycards, when you want to add more weapons, you need to download the addon from my github and edit the config.

How does the config work?

it is simple and you should understand it. If not ask for help in the comments and send a friend request, i will help you then.

Do i need to restart the server, after changing something?

After editing the config everything should work fine. If not restart the Server. If there is still a problem and you aren't a developer, dont touch anything, just write a comment with the error and i will try to fix it.
